# RealTimeGraphs
This repository contains code that automatically updates selected figures from [Macroeconomics, 10th Canadian Edition](https://www.pearson.com/en-ca/subject-catalog/p/macroeconomics-canadian-edition/P200000011472/9780138203894). These figures update monthly to ensure up-to-date teaching resources are always available.

## Instructions to access updated figures

To access the most recent version of each figure, you can use the following stable URL: 

> http<nolink>://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevortombe/RealTimeGraphs/main/Figures/XXX.png

where XXX is the figure title, which follows the pattern "Fig02-001.png" for the first figure in chapter 2. For example, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevortombe/RealTimeGraphs/main/Figures/Fig02-003.png

All figures are stored in the **Figures** folder.

## Instructions to access updated data

All data files are stored in the **Data** folder as excel files for each chapter. Within each excel file are separate tabs that contain the underlying data for each figure. These can be downloaded using a similar stable URL as for figures. For example, https://github.com/trevortombe/RealTimeGraphs/raw/main/Data/C02%20Figures.xlsx will fetch the chapter 2 data file.
