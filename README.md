# RealTimeGraphs
Experimental code to automatically update selected figures. Currently Chapter 2 figures are included, but more can be added.

## Instructions to access updated figures

To access the most recent version of each figure, you can use the following stable URL:

<div style="display: inline">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevortombe/RealTimeGraphs/main/Figures/XXX.png</div>

where XXX is the figure title, which follows the pattern "Fig02-001.png" for the first figure in chapter 2. For example, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevortombe/RealTimeGraphs/main/Figures/Fig02-003.png

All figures are stored in the **Figures** folder.

## Instructions to access updated data

All data files are stored in the **Data** folder as excel files for each chapter. Within each excel file are separate tabs that contain the underlying data for each figure.
